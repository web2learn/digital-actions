                        <h5>Why this resource?
</h5><p>Digital actions (citizen engagement activities for a social purpose) have a big learning potential. 
The purpose of this resource is to understand the learning potential from the perspective of (digital) skills gain.</p> 
<p>Competences and skills gained during a social participation activity, taking place within a university or a community, and ways of understanding how they develop and how they can be assessed, is the objective of this training resource.</p>
<p>It is designed for organisers of digital actions (citizen engagement activities for a social purpose) allowing them to identify the learning potential of these actions, and the skills gained therein.</p>
<p>This training resource is part of hands-on digital action activities carried out by HEIDI partners, academic staff and students and citizen communities. The materials are designed to provide a better understanding of frameworks and methodologies for digital skills development during citizen engagement activities. The training materials form an integral part of Intellectual Output 4 (IO4) of the HEIDI project (<a href="https://heidiproject.eu/?lang=el">https://heidiproject.eu/?lang=el</a>).</p>
                        <h5>What are the learning outcomes?</h5>
                        <ul><li>acquire a deeper understanding of digital skills development through bottom-up digital action activities.</li>
                        <li>explore the variety of frameworks on skills development, as well as of methodologies on digital skills assessment.</li>
                        <li>learn how HEIs’ digital upskilling can become beneficial to local communities through concrete examples from University College London.</li></ul>
                        <h5>Context</h5>
                        <p>The training materials present achievements of the EU-funded project HEIDI: ‘Digital Actions at HEIs as a catalyst for social change in the COVID-19 crisis’ (<a href="https://heidiproject.eu/">https://heidiproject.eu/</a>)</p>
